This repo contains the summary of the things that I learnt in the advanced packaging course. It basically works as a place where I document my understanding. I will also upload any other resources that I find helpful.

flipchip_bga.aedt contains an ANSYS Electronics Desktop (AEDT) model of a Flip-Chip Ball Grid Array (BGA) package, developed for studying package-level design and simulation. The file includes the 3D structure of the flip-chip interconnect, solder bumps, and substrate, making it suitable for analyzing signal integrity, power distribution, and high-speed channel performance. It can be used as a reference for researchers, engineers, or students working on advanced IC packaging, SI/PI evaluation, and electromagnetic modeling.

package_from_scratch.aedt includes an ANSYS Electronics Desktop (AEDT) project for package design created from scratch, providing a base setup to model and simulate advanced electronic packaging structures. The project can be used to explore geometry creation, material assignment, and electromagnetic analysis workflows in AEDT, making it a useful reference for learning package modeling fundamentals as well as conducting research in signal integrity, power integrity, and thermal-aware IC packaging.
